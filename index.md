I'm a first year Ph.D student in Planetary Science at Purdue University. Under my advisor, <a href="https://www.eaps.purdue.edu/bramson/index.html">Dr. Ali Bramson</a>, I research the impact that subsurface features have on radar observations of planetary bodies. Most of my research involves using laboratory/field analogues to help contrain models and provide the community with a better understanding of planetary bodies. Currently, I am investigating the impact that layer thickness in the Martian Polar Layer Deposits has on the returned power of radar signals. I hope to expand my research and techniques to the Moon and Europa in the near future.

From growing up in a barrier island pine forest to hauling peat samples out of the middle of the Everglades, I've developed an evergrowing curiosity with nature and researching the complex dynamics within harsh environments. This passion drives both my academic pursuits to investigate extreme environments and my desire to use my knowledge and techniques to help protect the most important planet.
